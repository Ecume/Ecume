<ul>
    <li>I am making a 3d printed robotic arm that can be controled by a glove you wear. This will be using arduino's code whilst the rasberry pi will use open cv for the camera that is going to be on the arm. A rust server will be running to http requests from a phone app to the server changing the open cv configuration.
