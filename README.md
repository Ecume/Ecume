### Welcome ðŸ˜Š


## Current Projects
<ul>
    <li>I am making a 3d printed robotic arm that can be controled by a glove you wear. This will be using arduino's code whilst the rasberry pi will use open cv for the camera that is going to be on the arm. A rust server will be running to http requests from a phone app to the server changing the open cv configuration.
</ul>

## Future Projects
<ul>
    <li>I eventually want to make a octopath traveler like game in unity which is heavily story and mechanics based
    <li>I want to create a physics engine to test my knowledge from my physics class in my school
</ul>
